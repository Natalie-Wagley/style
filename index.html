        <h3>Design Background and Future</h3>
    
        <p>My interest in design started in high school.  The few multimedia courses, art classes, and a web design course introduced me to the art of design.  It was ultimately the web design course that intrigued me to major in Graphic Design.  Through the courses I have completed so far, my focus leans toward web design and marketing/editorial design but am finding new areas that I am interested in.  My favorite projects to date have dealt with brand identity and editorial design.  Other projects I have done are displayed on my <a href= "https://www.behance.net/nataliewagley1">behance</a> site.</p>
    
        <p>In this course, I hope to build off of basic knowledge I have of html and css.  Learning new things about design and challenging myself is something I love to do.  Looking into the future, I want to move to a bigger city and work for a company within the field of web and marketing design.  I’d love to do something with social media marketing or anything pertaining to design but would be grateful for any design opportunity given to me.</p>
